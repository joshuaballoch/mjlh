<p>In the last few years, online pharmacies, especially Canadian online   pharmacies, have been a hot topic in the news. Consumer-patients have turned to   the internet in an attempt to minimize the cost of pharmaceuticals. This has   sparked concern over the safety of drugs purchased with a few keystrokes and   mouse-clicks from pharmacies existing somewhere in cyberspace. Are these   businesses regulated effectively by governments? Legislation has been tabled in   both houses of the US Congress and the FDA and Canadian pharmacists'   organizations have issued guidelines and policies for buying pharmaceuticals   online as regulators attempt to keep up with technology.   
<p>The "Ryan Haight Act" co-sponsored by Congressmen Waxman and <A href="http://tomdavis.house.gov/cgi-data/news/files/153.shtml">Davis</A> in   Congress and by Senators <A href="http://feinstein.senate.gov/05releases/r-internet-pharm.htm">Feinstein</A> and Coleman in the Senate introduced to the US Congress on February 16, 2005.   The bill was referred to the Subcommittee on Health on March 14, 2005.
