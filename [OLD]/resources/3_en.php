<p>The <A href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/p-8.6/93196.html">Personal   Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act</A> (PIPEDA) extends   legislative protection to personal information in the private sectors. This   federal legislation imposes mandatory standards, and applies to all   organizations that collect, use or disclose personal information in the course   of a "commercial activity".   

<p><b>Scope of Application</b></p>
<p>The scope of application of the PIPEDA to health information has been the   subject of considerable concern and uncertainty, in particular related to the   meaning of "commercial activity" [PIPEDA, S.C. 2000, c.5., s. 2(1)]. The   division between commercial and non-commercial activities may not necessarily be   the same as between private and public sectors.   
<UL>
  <LI><U>Private and Public Sectors</U>: For example, the fact that health   services are publicly paid for by provincial health care plans seems an unlikely   basis for treating them as non-commercial when similar services provided for a   fee outside provincial health plans, perhaps by the same professionals, would   likely be characterized as being commercial.   
  <LI><U>Charitable and Non-Profit Organizations</U>: Non-Profit status does not   automatically exempt an organization from the application of the Act. However,   most non-profits are not subject to the Act because they do not engage in   commercial activities.

  <LI>First Canadian court decision to examine the meaning of "commercial   activity" within the context of PIPEDA: <EM>Rodgers v. Calvert</EM> (2004), 244   D.L.R. (4th) 479. </LI>

<p><b>Substantially Similar Provincial Legislations</b></p>
<p>Section 26(2)(b) provides grounds for an exemption to organizations and   activities if the health information legislation enacted by a province applies   and is deemed "substantially similar" to the PIPEDA by the Governor in Council.   To date, the Ontario, Alberta, British Columbia and Quebec legislations <A href="http://www.privcom.gc.ca/legislation/ss_index_e.asp">have been found to be   "substantially similar"</A>.   

<p><b>Rights of the Individual to Access Own Information</b></p>
<p>Under the PIPEDA and each of the provincial initiatives, individuals will   enjoy a right to access their own personal health information held by a   regulated entity, subject to a number of specific limitations. Exemptions, while   varying substantially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, may include, among   others, circumstances where the release of information would risk harm to the   applicant, to another person or to public safety, or reveal third party personal   information. In the context of genetic information that can sometimes reveal   information regarding a person's relatives or entire groups of people, opinion   is mixed as to whether genetic information should be treated differently from   other types of health information. It is arguable that a corollary right not to   be exposed to certain information (eg. Information indicating that one has a   genetic predisposition to a certain illness). </p>
