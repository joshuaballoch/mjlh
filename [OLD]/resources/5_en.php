<p>60-year-old Marielle Houle, who helped her ailing son commit suicide as he   struggled with the early stages of multiple sclerosis, was spared jail time on   January 27, 2006 and sentenced to three years of probation. The maximum penalty   for such a crime is 14 years' imprisonment. Quebec Superior Court Justice   Maurice Laramée stressed that Houle's sentence is not to be used as a general   model in other cases.   
<p>Houle's son, Charles Fariala, a playwright and nurse, took a cocktail of   drugs from a recipe he found on the Internet and then his mother put a plastic   bag over his head to asphyxiate him. Houle's lawyer Salvatore Mascia said   federal legislation on assisted suicide is needed, and Justice Laramée noted   that if Canada had such legislation, <A href="http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Law/2006/01/23/1407787-cp.html">"we wouldn't   be here."</A>
