<p><A href="http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060126/alberta_private_healthcare_060126/20060127?hub=Canada">Alberta   Premier Ralph Klein suggested on January 26, 2005</A> that some of the   province's so-called "third way" reforms, a nine-point healthcare plan that his   caucus has unanimously agreed to move ahead with, might violate the <EM>Canada   Health Act</EM>. It would allow people to buy private insurance for   non-essential procedures, which effectively allows queue-jumping by patients   willing to pay, and permits doctors to practise in both the public and private   health systems. Alberta has not yet tabled legislation, but watch for it this   spring in the coming session of the Alberta legislature: see also stories by <A href="http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20051108/alberta_healthcare_051108?s_name=&no_ads=">CTV</A> and by <A href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20060127.NATS27-1/TPStory/TPHealth/">Globe   and Mail</A>
<p>During the federal election campaign 
Stephen Harper promised to protect the 
  Canada Health Act against breaches.
   A federal-provincial "propaganda war"
    may be  
     brewing: <A href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20060201/ALTAHEALTH01/National/Idx">Globe   and Mail</A>
     
<p>It is unclear how Stephen Harper's pledge of 
"open federalism", his promise   to right the 
"fiscal imbalance", and the Conservative 
penchant for privatization  
 will jibe with the Prime Minister's vow to protect
  the Canada Health Act. Open  
   federalism is about the 
   federal government granting the 
   provinces wider freedom.   
   Will that include the freedom to go the privatization route? 
   Correcting the   fiscal imbalance means transferring federal 
   surpluses to financially   overburdened provinces. Will that 
   include transferring money to the richest   province in Canada? 
   Will the federal government be willing to transfer money   
   that it has historically used to enforce the Canada Health Act 
   - by attaching   strings and by threatening to discontinue/lessen 
   the transfers? Finally, if any   political party in Canada is 
   likely to support privatization, or at the very   least allow
    it to occur, it is the Conservatives. But will a minority  
     Conservative government, with the Liberals, NDP and Bloc 
     just waiting for an   excuse to bring it down?   
<p><b>The Conservative Government</b></p>
<A href="http://media.conservative.ca/video/20060113-Platform.pdf">According to the   Conservative Party platform</A> (PDF), Stephen Harper will work in conjunction   with the provinces on health care, and allow for a mix of public and private   health care delivery, as long as health care remains publicly funded and   universally accessible.
<p>"The Conservative Party is committed to ensuring that all Canadians 
have   access to timely, quality health care services regardless of 
their ability to   pay. We are committed to a universal, publicly 
funded health care system that   respects the five principles of 
the Canada Health Act and the Canadian Charter   of Rights and 
Freedoms."   
<p>Note that the Chaoulli decision only applies in Quebec, as the Supreme Court split 3-3 on whether 
the Canadian Charter has been violated, and a 4-3 majority found that the Quebec Charter 
had been violated. Strictly speaking, then, as a precedent Chaoulli is only good in Quebec. 
However, it will surely spark similar challenges elsewhere in Canada.  </p>
