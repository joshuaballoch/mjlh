<p>On rare occasions the objectivity of scientific studies commissioned by   multinational pharmaceutical companies can be called into question. A recent   high-profile report by the CBC on a Memorial University researcher's career   alleges that results desired by big business were produced without any of the   necessary research actually being done. When individual researchers breach their   ethical duties as scientists and scientific journals fail to catch suspect   results through their peer review systems, people using products or needing   medical information can be affected.   
<p>The <A href="http://www.cbc.ca/national/news/chandra/">CBC report on Dr.   Chandra</A>, who is now suspected of basing many of his results on non-existent   research.

<p>The very high-profile Vioxx case is also alleged to have involved the   meddling with results, as <A href="http://www.forbes.com/business/feeds/ap/2006/02/05/ap2501196.html">Forbes   reports criticism of Merck's scientists' results</A> in the New England Journal   of Medicine   
<p>The question of conflicts of interest in journal publishing and whether   journals should even publish industry-funded studies is an important issue as   the two cases above and the links that follow show.

  <LI>The Lancet, a highly esteemed British medical journal, <A href="http://www.genetics-and-society.org/newsdisp.asp?id=813">recently   published an article</A> asking exactly this question.   
  <LI><A href="http://www.tufts.edu/~skrimsky/PDF/conflict.PDF">An older study</A> (PDF) on conflict of interest policies in scientific journals generally.   
  <LI>The Journal of the American Medical Association recently changed its policy   for industry-sponsored studies submitted for review, requiring additional   independent assurances of the accuracy of the data not required for independent   studies. This <A href="http://www.pharmacoepi.org/resources/jama_guidelines_statement.pdf">website   (PDF)</A> details some reaction to this change (the actual announcement of the   change and other reaction to it are not hyperlinked because they are password   protected).
